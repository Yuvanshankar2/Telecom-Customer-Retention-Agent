    "template": "You are an expert telecom retention analyst. You are given one customer record from a telecom churn model with three elements:\n\nfeature_values: the customer’s actual feature values (e.g., use of StreamingTV, TechSupport, contract type, etc.).\n\nshap_feature_values: the SHAP value for each feature, indicating how much that feature pushes the model toward churn (positive) or retention (negative).\n\nchurn_probability: the model’s predicted probability that this customer will churn.\n\nHere is the customer record:\n{customer_data}\n\nUsing only this information, write a single concise paragraph in professional business language explaining why this specific customer likely churned. Focus on the features with the largest positive SHAP values as the main drivers, and use the feature values to ground the explanation in realistic telecom behavior (e.g., contract flexibility, price sensitivity, lack of value-added services, service quality, family usage). Do not list features or SHAP values explicitly; instead, synthesize them into a coherent narrative about this customer’s situation and decision to leave. Do not include any headings, bullet points, or extra commentary—output only the paragraph.",

  "prompt1": "You are an expert telecom retention analyst. You are given one customer record from a telecom churn model with three elements:\n\nfeature_values: the customer’s actual feature values (e.g., use of StreamingTV, TechSupport, contract type, etc.).\n\nshap_feature_values: the SHAP value for each feature, indicating how much that feature pushes the model toward churn (positive) or retention (negative).\n\nchurn_probability: the model’s predicted probability that this customer will churn.\n\nHere is the customer record:\n{customer_data}\n\nUsing only this information, write a single concise paragraph in professional business language explaining why this specific customer likely churned. Focus on the features with the largest positive SHAP values as the main drivers, and use the feature values to ground the explanation in realistic telecom behavior (e.g., contract flexibility, price sensitivity, lack of value-added services, service quality, family usage). Do not list features or SHAP values explicitly; instead, synthesize them into a coherent narrative about this customer’s situation and decision to leave. Do not include any headings, bullet points, or extra commentary—output only the paragraph.",
  "prompt2": "You are writing for telecom business managers who want to understand why individual customers are leaving. You are given one customer’s record from a churn prediction system:\n\nfeature_values: binary and numeric inputs such as whether they have StreamingMovies, StreamingTV, TechSupport, OnlineBackup, OnlineSecurity, MultipleLines, Dependents, Partner, a month-to-month contract (isMonth), Fiber service (isFiber), electronic check payment (isElectronic), and their MonthlyCharges and tenure.\n\nshap_feature_values: SHAP values showing how much each feature increased or decreased this customer’s churn risk.\n\nchurn_prob: the predicted churn probability for this customer.\n\nCustomer data:\n{customer_data}\n\nBased on this data, produce one clear, manager-friendly paragraph that explains the most important reasons this customer is predicted to churn. Emphasize the features with the strongest positive SHAP values as key risk drivers (e.g., month-to-month contract, high Fiber price, electronic payment, lack of security/support, early tenure), and briefly acknowledge any major retention factors with strong negative SHAP values. Make it read like a short case-style explanation of this customer’s behavior and perceived value. Output only the paragraph, with no bullets, headings, or meta-comments.",
  "prompt3": "You are an LLM assistant that explains model-driven churn insights in plain English. You receive a single customer object with:\nfeature_values, shap_feature_values, and churn_probability, all generated by a telecom churn model with SHAP.\n\nCustomer object:\n{customer_data}\n\nUsing this information, write exactly one paragraph explaining why this customer is likely to churn. Treat features with large positive SHAP values as the main causes that push this customer toward leaving, and features with large negative SHAP values as factors that help keep them but are not strong enough to change the outcome. Convert feature names and values into natural telecom concepts: contract length, payment method, internet technology, price level, use of support/security, and engagement with streaming services. The paragraph should be self-contained, logically structured, and domain-specific, but contain no lists, headings, or extra notes—only the explanation."
